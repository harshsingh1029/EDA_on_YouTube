# Exploratory Data Analysis on YouTube Data

Domain: Social Media

Project Description: 

I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of over 100,000 YouTube videos from August 2020 to December 2021, focusing on the USA, Canada, and Great Britain. The dataset contained information about the video title, description, category, views, likes, dislikes, comments, tags, and publish date. I analyzed these attributes to uncover hidden trends and insights within the YouTube data. I also explored the impact of YouTube's decision to hide dislikes in November 2021 and its effects on user engagement and feedback.

- Achievements: 
    * I revealed valuable insights into user behavior and content trends on YouTube during a transformative period
    * I successfully handled missing data, converted date formats, and conducted statistical analysis using Python libraries such as 
      Pandas and NumPy.
    * I identified top-performing channels, videos with the most and least likes/dislikes, and their potential implications for 
      YouTube's algorithm and recommendations.

- Tools/Skills Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Kaggle dataset (YouTube Trending Video Statistics), proficiency in exploratory data analysis techniques.
